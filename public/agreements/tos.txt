Terms of Service (TOS)
Last Revised: May 11, 2025

1. Acceptance of Terms
By accessing or using Social Circles (the “Game”), you (“Player,” “You”) irrevocably agree to be bound by these Terms of Service (“TOS”). If you do not agree, you must immediately cease all access and use—and be prepared for us to enforce every clause of this agreement to the fullest extent.

2. Eligibility
You must be at least 13 years old to register. Falsifying your age or any registration information constitutes fraud, and will result in immediate account termination, potential legal action, and public notice of your wrongdoing at our discretion.

3. Account Registration & Security
3.1. You must provide accurate, complete registration information.
3.2. You alone are responsible for safeguarding your username and password—if you choose “password123,” you forfeit any sympathy.
3.3. Any unauthorized access or suspicious activity may result in instant suspension, forced data purges, and possible criminal charges.

4. Code of Conduct
4.1. Harassment, hate speech, cheating, exploit use, or any conduct that “ruins the social experience” for others is strictly forbidden.
4.2. A single infraction can result in permanent banishment, loss of all virtual assets, and a public naming-and-shaming campaign.
4.3. No appeals. No second chances. Our decisions are final.

5. License to Use
Social Circles Inc. grants you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to download, install, and play the Game for personal, non-commercial entertainment only. Violate this, and the license is revoked without notice.

6. Intellectual Property
All Game Materials—including code, graphics, audio, designs, and storylines—are the sole property of Social Circles Inc. Unauthorized copying, reverse engineering, modification, or derivative works constitute infringement, punishable by civil and criminal penalties. We will not hesitate to pursue damages.

7. In-Game Purchases
7.1. All purchases of virtual currency, items, or subscriptions are final. No refunds, exchanges, or “rollbacks”—ever.
7.2. Chargeback attempts will trigger immediate account suspension, debt collection efforts, and potential small-claims litigation.

8. Updates & Maintenance
Social Circles Inc. may, at any time and without notice, update, suspend, or discontinue the Game or your access to it. You assume all risk for lost progress, changes in features, or removal of content.

9. Data Collection & Privacy Waiver
9.1. By using the Game, you irrevocably waive any expectation of privacy. We collect, analyze, store, and share all data you generate—chat logs, voice comms, play patterns, keystrokes, biometric inputs, and any other metadata you produce.
9.2. We may sell or license your data to third parties, target you with ads based on your most personal behaviors, and train AI models on your interactions for our amusement.
9.3. You forfeit any right to data protection claims, privacy actions, or class-action suits arising from this data usage. You are our product; embrace your new role.

10. Disclaimers & Limitation of Liability
The Game is provided “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE.” Social Circles Inc. disclaims all warranties, express or implied, and will not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising from your use or inability to use the Game.

11. Indemnification
You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Social Circles Inc., its officers, directors, employees, and agents from any claim, demand, loss, liability, or expense (including attorneys’ fees) arising out of your breach of these TOS or any wrongful conduct.

12. Termination
Social Circles Inc. may suspend or terminate your account and access, in whole or in part, at any time and for any reason, with or without notice. Upon termination, all rights granted to you under these TOS cease immediately, and you must destroy all copies of the Game.

13. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution
These TOS are governed by the laws of the State of Illinois, USA. All disputes will be settled exclusively in state or federal courts located in Cook County, Illinois, and you expressly consent to personal jurisdiction there.

14. Severability
If any provision of these TOS is held invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect to the maximum extent permitted by law.

15. Changes to TOS
Social Circles Inc. reserves the right to modify these TOS at any time. Changes take effect upon posting to our website. Continued use after posting constitutes acceptance—no excuses will be entertained.
